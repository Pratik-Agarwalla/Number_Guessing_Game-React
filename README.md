# Number Guessing Game - React

## Description

This is a very simple number guessing game created using React. Usually this is the first game every programmer creates while learning a new programming language. I have also created this game as my first project. 

In this game the computer will generate a random number between 1 and 20. The user will have 20 changes to guess the number. If the guessed number is equal to the secret number then the users wins. otherwise if the number is lower than the secret number then it displays **too low** and if it is higher than the secret number it displays **too high**.

Our program also shows the highest score ever scored in the game. and also after the game ends its very easy to restart it by just clicking a button.

## Features

- Randomly generated number between 1 and 20.
- User input for guessing the number.
- Feedback messages based on the correctness of the guess.
- Score tracking with a highscore feature.
- Responsive design.

## How to Play

1. Enter a number between 1 and 20 in the input field.
2. Click the "Check!" button to see if your guess is correct.
3. Receive feedback on your guess (too high, too low, correct).
4. Your score is updated based on the accuracy of your guess.
5. Try to achieve the highest score and beat your previous highscore.
6. Click the "Again!" button to reset the game and start over.
